// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "The next step is to define and document what is required of the product and present that to customer/market analysts. This is done via a SRS (Software Requirement Specification) which contains all of the product requirements during the projects life cycle.";
const design = "The SRS provides the layout for architects to begin developing. There is usually more than one design approach proposed and notated in a DDS (Design Document Specification). Factors like risk assessment, design factors, budget and time are outlined and the optimal design approach is then selected and detailed in the DDS.";
const implementation = "At this point the actual development of the product begins. Developers follow outlined guidelines and use appropriate languages for the type of software being developed.";
const testing = "Now the product is tested to seek out any defects, which are subsequently reported, tracked, fixed and retested to meet the demands defined in the SRS.";
const maintenance = "Once everything has been tested and is ready for roll-out the product is deployed and given feedback the product could be released as is or with suggested changes. It is then maintained according to the existing customer base.";
